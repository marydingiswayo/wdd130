    <h2>W03 Learning Activity (2 of 2): Troubleshooting Functions</h2>
    <p>What should you do when your program isn’t working? If your
      program is small, you could examine each line of the program.
      However, if your program is large or contains multiple functions,
      there are better ways to find and fix the problems, including
      writing and running test functions, writing print statements, and
      using a debugger.</p>
    <h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
      should learn during this lesson.</p>
    <h4 id="err_types">Types of Mistakes</h4>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of mistakes or errors that
      a programmer might make when writing a program: syntax errors and
      logic errors. A <dfn>syntax error</dfn> is a mistake made by a
      programmer that violates the rules of a programming language such as
      misspelling a keyword, forgetting to type a closing parenthesis, or
      forgetting to type a colon (:) at the end of an <code>if</code>
      statement. A syntax error will cause the computer to terminate a
      Python program and print an error message to the terminal window. A
      <dfn>logic error</dfn> is a mistake made by a programmer that causes
      the computer to produce the wrong results. Often, a logic error will
      not cause the computer to terminate a program or to print an error
      message. It will simply cause the computer to produce incorrect
      results.
    </p>
    <h4 id="err_msgs">Error Messages</h4>
    <p>Regardless of the type of error (syntax or logic), if the
      computer prints an error message while executing a program, the
      first thing a programmer should do is read and understand the error
      message. Example&nbsp;1 shows a simple Python program that contains
      a syntax error. The message that the computer printed because of the
      syntax error is shown below example&nbsp;1.</p>
    <div id="ex1">

      <pre><code class="language-python hljs" data-highlighted="yes"><span class="hljs-comment"># Example 1</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span>():
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Are you surprised, Clark?)
# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
if __name__ == "</span>__main__<span class="hljs-string">":
    main()</span></code></pre>
      <pre class="console">&gt; python surprise.py
  File "C:\Users\cse111\surprise.py", <em>line 3</em>
    print("Are you surprised, Clark?)
                                    ^
<em>SyntaxError</em>: EOL while scanning string literal</pre>
    </div>
    <p>From the error message, we read that example&nbsp;1 contains a
      syntax error and that the error is on line&nbsp;3 of the program
      where there is something wrong with the string. By examining the
      error message and the program at line&nbsp;4, we learn that the
      programmer forgot to type the closing double quote at the end of the
      string. By the way, <dfn>EOL</dfn> that appears in the error message
      is an acronym for "end of line." You might also see the acronyms
      <dfn>EOF</dfn> and <dfn>EOT</dfn> which mean "end of file" and "end
      of transmission."
    </p>
    <p>If the computer prints an error message that you don’t
      understand, you can search the internet for its meaning. Simply copy
      and paste the error message into the search bar of your browser.
      Here are two of the search results from Google for the error message
      "SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal."</p>
    <div class="search">About 27,500 results (0.49 seconds)
      <a href="https://discover.cs.ucsb.edu/commonerrors/error/1010.xml">SyntaxError- EOL while scanning string
        literal</a>
      SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal "EOL" stands for "end of line". An EOL error means that Python hit
      the end of a line while going through a string.
      <a href="https://www.askpython.com/python/syntax-error-eol-while-scanning-string-literal">Syntax Error: EOL while
        scanning string literal - AskPython</a>
      EOL stands for "End of Line". The error means that the Python Interpreter reached the end of the line when it
      tried to scan the string literal. The string literals (constants) must be enclosed in single and double quotation
      marks.
    </div>
    <h4 id="print">Print Statements</h4>
    <p>If the computer doesn’t print an error message, but your program
      is producing incorrect results, you could add print statements to
      your program in strategic locations to help you find the mistakes.
      These print statements should print the value of the variables in
      your program so that you can examine the values to ensure they are
      correct. Example&nbsp;2 contains a program with a complex
      calculation for computing the remaining balance of a loan. Notice
      the print statements inside the functions indicated by the "Show variable values for debugging" comment.
      The programmer wrote these print statements at important points in
      the program, specifically near the beginning of each function and in
      the middle of the calculations.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Although print statements are simple to understand and add to a
      program and often helpful, in many situations they are not the most
      effective way to find logic errors.</p>
    <h4 id="test_funcs">Test Functions</h4>
    <p>Many programmers underestimate the effectiveness of writing and
      running test functions to find logic errors in a program. Many
      programmers will write a complete program with multiple functions
      and never pause to test any part of it. Instead, they will write the
      entire program and then do something similar to the following steps
      to test it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>Run the program and enter input like a user
          would.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Examine the program’s output and discover that the
          output is incorrect.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Review all the program’s code, make some small changes,
          and add print statements.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Repeat steps 1–3 again and again and again,
          spending lots of time trying to find and fix the
          errors.</div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This method for finding and fixing mistakes is time consuming
      because the programmer is trying to test the whole program at once.
      Instead, the programmer should test each individual function by
      writing and running test functions as explained in the
      <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse111-ww-course/week03/prepare-1.html">previous lesson</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="debugger">Using a Debugger</h4>
    <p>A <dfn>debugger</dfn> is a software development tool that allows
      a programmer to watch the computer execute the statements in a
      program. While using a debugger, a programmer can examine the values
      stored in a program’s variables as the computer executes each line
      of the program. A debugger is a very effective tool for finding
      mistakes in a program. Nearly all programming languages and
      environments include a debugger. Professional software developers
      use a debugger nearly every single work day. Most companies will not
      use a programming language unless that language includes a
      debugger.</p>
    <p>The Python programming language includes a debugger that you can
      use while writing a program in VS Code. It is much easier to learn
      how to use a debugger by watching someone use it than by reading
      about a debugger. Watch the following video that shows a BYU-Idaho
      faculty member using a debugger in VS Code to find mistakes in a
      program.</p>
    <ul class="videos">
      <li>
        <div>How to Use the <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_k7ubjwmu">Python Debugger in VS Code</a> <span class="duration">(17 minutes)</span>
          <div class="video"><iframe allowfullscreen="" title="Debugging a Python Program" src="./CSE 111 _ Learning ActivitiesW3_files/1157612.html"></iframe>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A debugger is also a great learning tool. Using a debugger to
      step through the statements of your program one at a time and
      examining the values of the variables after each step will show you
      exactly how Python works. Try it! If you don’t completely understand
      <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> statements,
      <code>while</code> loops, <code>for</code> loops, passing
      parameters, or returning a value from a function, then put one or
      more breakpoints in a program that contains those elements, start
      the program in the debugger, and step through it one line at a time.
      After the computer executes each statement, examine the values of
      the variables and predict in your mind how the next statement will
      change the values of the variables.
    </p>
    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
    <p>During this lesson, you are learning the difference between a
      syntax error and a logic error. A syntax error is a mistake made by
      a programmer that violates the rules of a programming language and
      prevents a program from running. Usually, you must fix all syntax
      errors before your program will run. After you fix all syntax
      errors, your program will run but may contain logic errors. A logic
      error is a mistake made by a programmer that causes the computer to
      produce the wrong results. Some tools that you can use to find and
      fix the logic errors in your programs are test functions, print
      statements, and a debugger.</p>
